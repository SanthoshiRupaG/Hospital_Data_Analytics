With the increasing number of patients and the need for medical resources, it has become difficult to keep track of the resources and to allocate doctors accordingly. 
Using data analytics in healthcare helps reduce these challenges. 
This project aims to analyze the dynamically changing data that includes the patientâ€™s age, the concerned department, seriousness of the condition, etc., 
thus helping the hospital managements to take data-driven decisions and choose the best options present for them respectively. 
These analytics provide a foundational understanding of healthcare, highlighting its importance in improving healthcare delivery.
The proposed system works on patient data, where the program analyses patient data and give conclusions on the huge given data. 
Through insightful analysis, the aim is to empower hospital to make data-driven decisions for resource allocation.
The use of data analytics in healthcare is crucial for managing the increasing number of patients and efficiently allocating medical resources. 
By analyzing dynamic data such as patient age, department, and condition severity, hospitals can make informed, data-driven decisions. 
This approach enhances healthcare delivery by optimizing resource allocation and improving overall patient care, thereby demonstrating the significant impact of data analytics on healthcare management. 
It enables hospitals with a centralized platform to manage their operations and enhance healthcare.
